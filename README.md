# Detection-of-Suicide-Related-Posts-in-Twitter-Data-streams-
Suicidal ideation detection in social media is an emerging research area that has significant challenges. Most of the time, the public release of information about a person's suicidal intentions can be used to detect this behaviour . Our project presents a method that uses Twitter to identify and report suicide warning signs. It also learns about user changes in online behaviour.Our approach uses text-scoring to identify warning signs in text. This method can be used to detect changes in online behavior that are related to psychological distress . It is very important that every individual takes the necessary steps to prevent suicides. This can be done by identifying and reducing the suicide level in a person's life through their social media usage.We try to find out the relationship between the users suicide state and their social media friendâ€™s suicide levels.If a particular tweet is associated with a suicide or related topic then we can easily separate the related ones from the non-suicide related ones.
